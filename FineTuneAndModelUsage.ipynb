      " Based on the provided information, it appears that Rochan Kumar Saravanakannan has a strong background in computer science and engineering, with experience in software development and research in autonomous driving and reinforcement learning. He has demonstrated skills in Python, Linux, Git, and various machine learning libraries. He has also worked on projects related to number plate recognition, traffic vehicle counting and tracking, and lane detection. Given his experience and skills, he could be a good fit for a basic German-speaking research institute with a focus on RL for trajectory and traffic-related applications. However, it would be important to further assess his fit based on specific requirements and expectations of the institute.\n"
